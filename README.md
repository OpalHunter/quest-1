Question One   What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?

1.   Cadence is a safe and secure programming language.   It has achieved this by seperating contracts and transactions and using Resource Oriented Programming.

2.  Cadence code is declarative which means it says what the task or outcome should be.   This makes it easier for the developer when writing a program.   It also makes it easier to read, audit and review.   This makes Cadence a very efficient means of coding.

3.  Cadence has been designed to be similar to other methods of coding.   This means developers can easily pick up and learn Cadence.  This makes switching to building on Flow very attractive to experienced coders, as they will find the transition to using Cadence fairly simple.

4.  Cadence picks up errors in coding and clearly points them out to the developer.   This makes coding less stressful as there is no need to debug a contract once it has been created.
